# Login and Registration System 🔐

## Project Overview
The Login and Registration System is a C++ project focused on managing user authentication through a registration process. It primarily involves collecting user credentials such as usernames and passwords. Upon successful registration, the system creates a file for each user in the database, storing their credentials securely. This project demonstrates basic user authentication mechanisms and file handling in C++.

## How to Use
1. **Register User:** Enter a username and password to create a new user account.
2. **Login User:** Use the registered credentials to log in to the system.
3. **Manage User Data:** The system securely stores user credentials in a file upon successful registration.

## System Capabilities
### User Roles
- **User**

### User Capabilities
- **Register Account:** Provide a unique username and a secure password to register.
- **Login to System:** Access the system using the registered credentials.
- **Secure Data Storage:** User credentials are securely stored in a file in the database.

## Features
- Secure registration and login process.
- User credentials are stored in individual files.
- Simple interface for easy user management.
- Demonstrates basic file handling and security principles in C++.

This project was developed as a training exercise in C++ with CODEALPHA to enhance understanding of user authentication and file management in software development. 💾
